- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add error handling where appropriate

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Creates a new code block with the specified options
 * @param {Object} options - Configuration options
 * @param {string} options.language - Programming language
 * @param {boolean} [options.withLines=false] - Whether to show line numbers
 * @returns {HTMLElement} The created code block element
 */
function createCodeBlock(options) {
  const { language, withLines = false } = options;
  // ... implementation
}
```
